The purpose of this project is to create a Wiki for wearable devices, which summarizes the knowledge of relevant aspects of wearable devices, including, but not limited to, the introduction of their operating systems, processors, health monitoring features, etc. This Wiki can help you:

- Learn about wearable devices
- Popularize the content of this wiki to people who do not know about it
- Help you buy wearable devices

In short, you can learn about various wearable devices with the help of this Wiki.

Currently, the project is in its infancy, so if you know enough about a particular wearable device to join the initial writeup, you can contact the administrators via.

- Gitee private message (inefficient)
- Teams community (faster)
- OICQ/WeLink (fastest)
